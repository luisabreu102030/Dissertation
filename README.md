## Repository containing my Dissertation manuscript.

My master’s dissertation, entitled **“Automatic detection of daily living activities in people with Parkinson’s disease using kinematic data”**, was focused on the application of <ins>deep learning algorithms</ins> in the <ins>recognition of daily activities</ins> performed by Parkinson’s disease patients through <ins>kinematic data (acceleration and angular velocity)</ins>. 

During my master’s dissertation I have also developed a deep learning algorithm capable of <ins>recognizing gait events</ins>, namely the initial foot contact and the final foot contact.

My master’s dissertation was framed in [BiRDLAB +sense project](http://birdlab.dei.uminho.pt/biofeedback-devices/), which aims to develop high technological solutions capable of monitoring, assessing, and assisting Parkinson’s disease patients.
