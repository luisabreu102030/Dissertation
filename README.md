## Repository containing my Dissertation manuscript.

<p>My master’s dissertation, entitled “Automatic detection of daily living activities in people with Parkinson’s disease using kinematic data”, was focused on the application of deep learning algorithms in the recognition of daily activities performed by Parkinson’s disease patients through kinematic data (acceleration and angular velocity). During my master’s dissertation I have also developed a deep learning algorithm capable of recognizing gait events, namely the initial foot contact and the final foot contact. </p>

<p>My master’s dissertation was framed in BiRDLAB +sense project, which aims to develop high technological solutions capable of monitoring, assessing, and 
assisting Parkinson’s disease patients. </p>
