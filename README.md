## Repository containing my Dissertation manuscript.

My master’s dissertation, entitled **“Automatic detection of daily living activities in people with Parkinson’s disease using kinematic data”**, was focused on the application of <ins>deep learning algorithms</ins> in the <ins>recognition of daily activities</ins> performed by Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients through <ins>kinematic data (acceleration and angular velocity)</ins>. 

During my master’s dissertation I have also developed a deep learning algorithm capable of <ins>recognizing gait events</ins>, namely the initial foot contact (IC) and the final foot contact (FC).

My master’s dissertation was framed in [BiRDLAB +sense project](http://birdlab.dei.uminho.pt/biofeedback-devices/), which aims to develop high technological solutions capable of monitoring, assessing, and assisting Parkinson’s disease patients.

In my dissertation you will find :
- A literature review performed by me;
- A Parkinson's disease Patient data collection protocol designed and implemented by me;
- What Data cleaning steps were applyied
- How the Dataset divided into train, validation and test dataset.
- How does the proposed model was optimized, trained, validated and finally tested against unknown data.

### DL model for Human Activity Recognition in PD patients results

### DL model for Human Walk IC/FC detection in PD patients results
